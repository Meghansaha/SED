## The kind of assessment and how frequent.

1. The application and evaluation process. Maybe applicants use it to apply

2. Once the candidate has been accepted, on a regular basis to capture sentiment, emotional and psychological health. A reminder users can set.

3. After the candidate has been accepted, evaluate their personality to capture curiosity, interests, morning/evening, introvert/extrovert

4. After the candidate has been accepted, evaluate their personality for entrepreneur, management, leadership, negotiation

5. At set milestones, get cohort's sentiment on project progress "Do you think the project will be successful?

6. At set milestones, the teachers, mentors, coaches and staff evaluate individual and team health

7. Capture subjects and content people are struggling with. Example: "that video sucked and confused me."

## The types of data can be grouped in two categories.

1. Regular checkin with cohorts. Ideally, each person checks in weekly with regular emotional, psychological status

2. Data entered by staff, teachers, and coaches. This would be milestones, schedules and timelines. The data would be used to track progress of each co-hort group.

## The types of reports Shawna would like to see.

1. Correlate the co-hort sentiment and timeline data into graphs. It combines both categories of data.

2. Active/inActive graph to catch when individuals go silent.

3. Overly positive sentiment may indicate the person is struggling and afraid to admit they are struggling. 

4. Team health to measure group progress
